# AI-Agent-for-Little-go-Gaming
Developed an AI agent to play a small version of the Go game, a reduced board size of Go game, based on no- suicide and KO rules. Both game playing and reinforcement learning algorithms were tried to improve the winning percentage. The Q leaning in this project is computational expensive; eventually, minmax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning technique was applied and defeated the pre-designed random, greedy, and aggressive players.
